There are several built-in sequence types available in Python, including:

1. `Lists`: Lists are ordered collections of objects that can be added, removed, and modified. They can contain objects of any type.

2. `Tuples`: Tuples are ordered collections of objects that are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified once they are created.

3. `Strings`: Strings are sequences of characters that are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified once they are created.

4. `Dictionaries`: Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs that can be added, removed, and modified.

5. `Sets`: Sets are unordered collections of unique objects that can be added, removed, and modified.

6. `Ranges`: Ranges are immutable sequences of numbers that are commonly used for looping.

7. Bytes and Bytearrays: Bytes are sequences of bytes that represent a sequence of numbers between 0 and 255. They are denoted by the prefix b and can be created using the `bytes()` or `bytearray()` functions.
