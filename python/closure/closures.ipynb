    "# CLOSURE\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a closure is a function object that has access to variables in its enclosing `lexical scope`, even when the function is called outside that scope. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A closure is created when a nested function references a value from its enclosing scope.\n",
    "     \n",
    "- The inner function is said to `\"close over\"` the variables defined in the outer function, creating a closure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0. COMPILED AND/OR INTERPRETED ??? (`Hint`: -> BOTH)\n",
    "\n",
    "Key to understanding the behavior of a closure is understanding the behavior of the Python interpreter during `Compile Time`. A common misperception is that Python is not a compiled language. The reality is that it is complied `and` interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A module source is first complied to `byte code`.\n",
    "- The interpreter interprets this byte code at `run time`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. COMPILE TIME: \n",
    "\n",
    "During the compilation phase, the Python interpreter checks your code for syntactical errors and translates it into `bytecode`, which is a lower-level representation of your code that can be executed by the `Python Virtual Machine`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. RUN TIME:\n",
    "\n",
    "During the run time phase, the Python Virtual Machine executes the bytecode generated during the compilation phase. This is when your program actually runs, and `any dynamic behavior`, such as user input, database access, or network communication occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. CONCLUSION:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable lookups occur at runtime, but the location of the variable in memory is determined at compile time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python, a variable lookup refers to the process of finding the value of a variable in your code when it is referenced. This process happens at runtime, which means that it occurs when your code is actually being executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- However, the location of the variable in memory where the value is stored is determined at compile time. When Python compiles your code, it creates `a table` of all the variables used in your program, along with their memory locations. This table is then used during runtime to quickly locate the memory location of a variable when it is referenced in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This `separation of concerns` between the compile time and runtime phases of execution allows Python to efficiently access variables during program execution without having to repeatedly search for their memory locations."
