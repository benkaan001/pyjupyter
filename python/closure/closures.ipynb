    "## CLOSURE\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a closure is a function object that has access to variables in its enclosing `lexical scope`, even when the function is called outside that scope. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A closure is created when a nested function references a value from its enclosing scope.\n",
    "     \n",
    "- The inner function is said to `\"close over\"` the variables defined in the outer function, creating a closure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0. COMPILED AND/OR INTERPRETED ??? (`Hint`: -> BOTH)\n",
    "\n",
    "Key to understanding the behavior of a closure is understanding the behavior of the Python interpreter during `Compile Time`. A common misperception is that Python is not a compiled language. The reality is that it is complied `and` interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A module source is first complied to `byte code`.\n",
    "- The interpreter interprets this byte code at `run time`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write Python code, it is first translated into byte code by the Python interpreter. Byte code is a low-level, platform-independent representation of your Python code. The byte code is then executed by the Python virtual machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a Python program, the Python interpreter reads the source code of the program and compiles it into byte code. The byte code is stored in `.pyc` files (compiled Python files) that are generated in the same directory as the source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the program again, the Python interpreter first checks to see if there is a .pyc file for the source code. If there is, and the source code has not changed since the last time the .pyc file was generated, the Python interpreter skips the compilation step and uses the existing .pyc file. This can make subsequent runs of the program faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. COMPILE TIME: \n",
    "\n",
    "During the compilation phase, the Python interpreter checks your code for syntactical errors and translates it into `bytecode`, which is a lower-level representation of your code that can be executed by the `Python Virtual Machine`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python virtual machine is responsible for executing the byte code. It reads the byte code and performs the operations specified by the byte code instructions. The virtual machine is designed to be platform-independent, which means that Python programs can be run on any platform that has a Python interpreter and a Python virtual machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. RUN TIME:\n",
    "\n",
    "During the run time phase, the Python Virtual Machine executes the bytecode generated during the compilation phase. This is when your program actually runs, and `any dynamic behavior`, such as user input, database access, or network communication occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. CONCLUSION:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable lookups occur at runtime, but the location of the variable in memory is determined at compile time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python, a variable lookup refers to the process of finding the value of a variable in your code when it is referenced. This process happens at runtime, which means that it occurs when your code is actually being executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- However, the location of the variable in memory where the value is stored is determined at compile time. When Python compiles your code, it creates `a table` of all the variables used in your program, along with their memory locations. This table is then used during runtime to quickly locate the memory location of a variable when it is referenced in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This `separation of concerns` between the compile time and runtime phases of execution allows Python to efficiently access variables during program execution without having to repeatedly search for their memory locations."

    "The `level_six()` function returns the result of calling the `chonky()` function, which in turn calls the `donky()` function and returns the result of calling its `inner()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "When `chonky()` is called, it defines a local variable `x` and sets its value to \"chonky x\". However, there is also a global variable `x` defined outside of `level_six()`, which has the value \"global x\". When the `inner()` function is called inside the `donky()` function, it references the `x` variable, but there is no local `x` variable defined in `inner()`, so Python looks for it in the enclosing `donky()` function and finds the value of `x` to be \"global x\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The `inner()` function also references the `z` variable, which is defined in the enclosing `level_six()` function. When the `donky()` function is defined, it defines a local variable `z` and sets its value to \"donky `z`\". However, this local `z` variable is never used, so when the `inner()` function references `z`, Python looks for it in the enclosing `level_six()` function and finds the value of `z` to be \"outer `z`\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the `inner()` function returns a tuple containing the values of x, y, and `z`. When `chonky()` calls f(\"y arg\"), f is a reference to the `inner()` function, and \"y arg\" is passed as the argument y. The `inner()` function returns the values \"global x\", \"y arg\", and \"outer `z`\", so the result of `chonky()` is (\"global x\", \"y arg\", \"outer `z`\"). Therefore, `level_six()` returns this same tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the `inner()` function is a closure that has access to the variables `x` and `z` defined in the enclosing `donky()` and `level_six()` functions, respectively. However, because there is a global variable `x` defined outside of `level_six()`, the value of `x` that is referenced by `inner()` is the global value rather than the local value defined in `chonky()`."
